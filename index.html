            <h2>Fascinating Scientific Facts You Experience Everyday</h2>
            <p>Every day we experience phenomena that are rooted in science. From the boiling of water to the beauty of a rainbow, these scientific events shape our daily lives. Let's dive into some amazing mysterious science facts that occur all around us.</p>

            <!-- Fact 1 -->
            <div class="fact">
                <h3>Fact 1: Quantum Internet is Near</h3>
                <p>Quantum internet is not just a futuristic concept anymore—scientists are actively working to make it a reality. Traditional internet uses bits (0s and 1s) to transmit information, but quantum internet would rely on qubits, leveraging the principles of quantum entanglement. This means that data can be transferred instantaneously between two points, regardless of the distance. One major advantage is the potential for unhackable communication, as any attempt to intercept quantum data would disturb the entanglement, making eavesdropping impossible. Though we are still in the experimental stages, countries like China and the USA have already tested quantum satellites, paving the way for a new era of secure global communication.</p>

            <!-- Fact 2 -->
            <div class="fact">
                <h3>Fact 2: Formation of Rainbows</h3>
                <p>Rainbows form when sunlight passes through water droplets, creating a spectrum of colors. This occurs due to the refraction, dispersion, and reflection of light within the droplets.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Fact 3 -->
            <div class="fact">
                <h3>Fact 3: Gravity Keeps Us Grounded</h3>
                <p>Gravity is the force that prevents us from floating into space. It pulls objects toward the Earth's center, keeping everything grounded.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Fact 4 -->
            <div class="fact">
                <h3>Fact 4: The Refraction of Light</h3>
                <p>When light travels from one medium to another, like air to water, its speed changes, causing it to bend. This bending is called refraction, and it explains why objects look different under water.</p>
